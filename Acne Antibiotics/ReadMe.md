Characterization of Oral Antibiotics for Acne Treatment

Objective: Aim 1: Characterize the international distribution of oral antibiotic use for acne in the pediatric and young adult population ages 12 to 21. Aim 2: Characterize the international distribution of oral antibiotic use for acne in the adult population ages 22 to 60.

Rationale: Acne is a common and disabling medical condition, particularly amongst adolescents and young adults.[1] According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, acne is the most disabling skin condition worldwide, responsible for 0.28% of global burden from all diseases.[2] In addition to physical disfigurement, the profound psychosocial effects of acne have been recognized for over half a century.[3] Guidelines established by the American Academy of Dermatology recommend minimizing the duration of systemic antibiotics for the management of acne ideally to 3-4 months and no longer than 6 months in order to decrease risk of resistance.[1] A recent systematic review demonstrated that over 50% of P. acnes strains are reported as resistant in all major regions of the world.[4] In addition to promoting resistance, long-term oral antibiotic use has been associated with a number of adverse events including microbiome disruption and pharyngitis, as well as possible associations with inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.[5] Despite these adverse effects, oral antibiotics are often prescribed for acne for longer durations than acne guidelines recommend.[5] A large retrospective cohort study of teenagers in the UK revealed that 29% of antibiotic courses prescribed by general practitioners exceeded 6 months in duration.[5] A similar retrospective cohort study of teenagers and young adults in the US found that 18% of antibiotic courses exceeded 6 months.[6] Our study will investigate oral antibiotic use for acne over the last ten years across the globe in both pediatric/young adult and adult populations. OHDSI network evidence will identify areas of the globe most in need of improving guideline concordance.
